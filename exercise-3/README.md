# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

#rm#
The <rm> command can be used to _delete_ a `file`. For example:

<rm README.md>

Here's some more information about <rm>:

1. <rm> can only be used in delete file.
2. Sometimes it just does not work.

See `complete` branch for answers.
